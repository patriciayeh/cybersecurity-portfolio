## 🛡️ TryHackMe – Defensive Security Intro

**Room Overview**  
This room introduces the fundamentals of **defensive cybersecurity** and the role of the **Blue Team** in protecting systems, networks, and data.  
I learned how organizations **prevent, detect, and respond** to cyber threats through SOC operations, threat intelligence, digital forensics, incident response, and malware analysis.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- **SOC Operations** → Monitoring systems, detecting suspicious activity, and investigating alerts  
- **Threat Intelligence** → Identifying adversaries, predicting attacks, and preparing defenses  
- **DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)** →  
  - Collecting and analyzing forensic evidence  
  - Following structured response methodologies  
  - Containment, eradication, and recovery processes  
- **Malware Analysis** → Understanding malware behavior through static and dynamic analysis  
- **SIEM Basics** → Hands-on investigation of security alerts using simulated environments

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used
- **SIEM** – Security Information and Event Management  
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds** – Understanding attacker tactics & techniques  
- **Logs & Monitoring** – Reviewing authentication attempts, IP activity, and network intrusions  
- **Digital Forensics** – Disk, memory, and log analysis

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Defensive security focuses on **protecting** systems rather than exploiting them.
- The **SOC** is the frontline team that monitors and responds to potential threats.
- **Threat intelligence** helps anticipate attacks and strengthen defenses.
- **DFIR** skills are critical for investigating incidents and minimizing damage.
- Malware analysis techniques (static & dynamic) are essential to understand evolving threats.

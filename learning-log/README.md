# 📝 Learning Log

Welcome to my brain dump of cybersecurity knowledge! This is where I take notes, jot down key concepts, and keep track of everything I’m learning from courses, books, workshops, and labs.

## What You’ll Find Here
- **courses/** – Notes from online courses (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, etc.)  
- **books/** – Key takeaways and summaries from cybersecurity reads  
- **workshops/** – Notes from WiCyS workshops, webinars, and bootcamps  
- **labs/** – Mini notes from lab exercises tied to what I’m learning

## How I Use This Folder
Every file is like a little diary entry:
- What I studied
- What tools or skills I used
- My personal takeaways

> Bonus: It’s my way of making sure I actually remember what I learn!

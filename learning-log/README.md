# Learning Log

This folder contains my organized learning notes from courses, books, workshops, and lab exercises. It reflects a systematic approach to tracking knowledge and understanding key concepts.

## Subfolders
- **courses/** – Notes from LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, and other professional courses  
- **books/** – Summaries and insights from cybersecurity literature  
- **workshops/** – Notes from webinars, bootcamps, and WiCyS events  
- **labs/** – Brief observations linked to learning exercises  

## File Format
Each file includes:
- Name and date  
- Objectives of the course or material  
- Key concepts and technical details learned  
- Tools used (if applicable)  
- Key takeaways and insights  

This approach ensures **knowledge is documented, structured, and easily referenced** as I progress.

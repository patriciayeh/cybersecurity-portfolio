# ðŸŽ“ Certifications

This folder is my study zone for certifications. Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on WiCyS Certified in Cybersecurityâ„ , but any other badges or certificates I go after will live here too.

## What Youâ€™ll Find
- Notes on topics covered
- Key concepts I need to master
- Progress tracking for exam readiness
- Study resources and prep tips

Itâ€™s like my personal guidebook to staying on top of cybersecurity knowledge and proving my skills officially.

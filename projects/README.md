# 💡 Projects

This folder is where I apply what I’ve learned to build cool stuff. From mini projects to structured exercises, this is where learning turns into action.

## Project Setup
Each project folder/file has:
- Project name & objective
- Tools & technologies used
- Step-by-step actions
- Outcomes or results
- Screenshots if needed

Think of this as my “show and tell” section — I explain what I did, how I did it, and what I learned along the way.

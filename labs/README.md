# 🛠️ Labs

This is where the fun happens! Labs are my hands-on playgrounds where theory meets practice. Here I tackle TryHackMe rooms, HackTheBox challenges, and my own little home experiments.

## How I Document Labs
Each lab file includes:
- Lab name & platform
- Date completed
- Objectives
- Step-by-step actions
- Tools used
- Lessons learned
- Screenshots (optional, in `../screenshots/`)

💡 Tip: Don’t be afraid to mess up! That’s where the real learning happens.

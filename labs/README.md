# Labs

This folder contains hands-on lab exercises, including TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and home lab projects. Labs are documented to demonstrate both technical understanding and the ability to apply concepts in practice.

## Documentation Guidelines
Each lab file includes:
- Lab name and platform  
- Date completed  
- Objectives and scope  
- Step-by-step actions and methodology  
- Tools and resources used  
- Lessons learned and observations  
- Screenshots (optional, stored in `../screenshots/`)  

The focus is on **applied learning and repeatable documentation** that demonstrates both skill acquisition and process.

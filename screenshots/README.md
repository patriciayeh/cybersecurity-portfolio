# ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

Welcome to the visual side of my portfolio! This folder holds screenshots and images from labs, projects, and experiments.

## How I Use Screenshots
- Capture important steps or configurations from labs  
- Include visuals from projects to show results  
- Reference them in lab/project Markdown files for context

Think of this as my portfolio scrapbook â€” pictures really do tell the story!
